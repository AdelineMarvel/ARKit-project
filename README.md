# AR Objects
A simple Augmented Reality app where you can put multiple objects in your scene.

# The Story Behind
I was not a coder, for starters. This project has really brought me out of my comfort zone and jump into the world of coding. 
I am very interested in Augmented Reality, how it combines our world with virtual ones.
So, I wanted to build my own AR app.
Making this was fun and challenging and I learn a lot of things along the way.
It is a simple app that still needs improvements
